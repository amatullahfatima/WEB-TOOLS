            <h3>Adventures</h3>
            <p>I love to travel and explore any chance I get. I have been to the Middle East multiple times. I have
                travelled to <em>India</em> and <em>Pakistan</em>.
                I also have been to a few states. I love to travel to explore new cultures and try different cuisines.
                Here is a list of countries I
                have been to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>America</li>
                <li>Saudi Arabia</li>
                <li>Qatar</li>
                <li>Dubai</li>
                <li>India</li>
                <li>Pakistan</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Speaking of adventure, I also love to go on long drives. I went on a long drive to see sand dunes and
                camels in Riyadh. I have also
                driven to Qatar from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
                While living in Texas, I drove south to Houston on a vacation. Going on long drives with family and
                friends is my favorite thing to
                do on vacations.

            <h3>Favorite Food</h3>
            <p>I am a huge foodie and I have a crazy sweetooth. <em>I love anything <strong>chocolate</strong>
                    flavored!</em>I love
                cupcakes, cinnamon rolls, ice
                creams, banana breads, and pancakes.
                Too much sugar is not good for my health though so I try to minimize it whenever I can.</p>
            <p>From savoury food, I really love having pizza, pasta, soup and anything with cheese. I like Indian dishes
                like Biryani and Butter
                Chicken.
                I have also tried chinese food only a few times and wish I could have it more often. </p>

            <h3>My Cats</h3>
            <p>When I lived in Riyadh I had a tabby kitten named <strong>Cookie</strong>. She was a stray cat. My dad
                found her when he was
                starting the car engine.
                He heard meows so he turned off the engine and it went silent then turned it back on and the meows
                started again.
                My dad opened the car engine to check where the sound was coming from and found there was a tabby kitten
                resting
                in the warm engine because of the harsh cold.</p>
            <p> Last year in January we started searching for kittens on the internet. We found a really cute Siamese on
                criaglist for $200.
                I named her <strong>Crystal</strong> and she became my best friend. She loves to play with her toys and
                she loves to go out and
                rest in the grass.
                She doesnt like seafood very much so we never feed her fish. She also loves to snack on chicken flavored
                treats.
