      <h3>My Class</h3>
      <p> My name is Amatullah Fatima, and I am 20 years old. I am currently taking a Web Design class. Through
        this course, I have been able to jump-start my professional career and gain exposure to website building.
        In the future, I may start a business, and knowing how to build websites will be a valuable asset to both
        me and my customers. This class taught me how to create a website from scratch using VisualStudio Code, using
        HTML, and CSS code.
        Additionally. I learned how to use FTP called FileZilla to transfer my web pages to an online server. I also
        learned to use websites like WordPress and W3 schools to make my websites look more attractive with the help
        of themes, CSS style sheets, floats, images, tables, and much more.</p>

        <figcaption class="w3-container w3-center">Shah Faisal Mosque located in Pakistan.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>I love to travel and explore any chance I get. I have been to the Middle East multiple times. I have
        travelled to <em>India</em> and <em>Pakistan</em>.
        I also have been to a few states. I love to travel to explore new cultures and try different cuisines.
        Here is a list of countries I
        have been to:
      </p>
      <ul class="w3-ul w3-small w3-theme-d5" style="width:20%">
        <li>America</li>
        <li>Saudi Arabia</li>
        <li>Qatar</li>
        <li>Dubai</li>
        <li>India</li>
        <li>Pakistan</li>
      </ul>



      <p>Speaking of adventure, I also love to go on long drives. I went on a long drive to see sand dunes and
        camels in Riyadh. I have also
        driven to Qatar from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
        While living in Texas, I drove south to Houston on a vacation. Going on long drives with family and
        friends is my favorite thing to
        do on vacations.

      <h3>Favorite Food</h3>
      <p>I am a huge foodie and I have a crazy sweetooth. <em>I love anything <strong>chocolate</strong>
          flavored!</em>I love
        cupcakes, cinnamon rolls, ice
        creams, banana breads, and pancakes.
        Too much sugar is not good for my health though so I try to minimize it whenever I can.</p>
      <p>From savoury food, I really love having pizza, pasta, soup and anything with cheese. I like Indian dishes
        like Biryani and Butter
        Chicken.
        I have also tried chinese food only a few times and wish I could have it more often. </p>

      <h3>My Cats</h3>
      <p>When I lived in Riyadh I had a tabby kitten named <strong>Cookie</strong>. She was a stray cat. My dad
        found her when he was
        starting the car engine.
        He heard meows so he turned off the engine and it went silent then turned it back on and the meows
        started again.
        My dad opened the car engine to check where the sound was coming from and found there was a tabby kitten
        resting
        in the warm engine because of the harsh cold.</p>
      <p> Last year in January we started searching for kittens on the internet. We found a really cute Siamese on
        criaglist for $200.
        I named her <strong>Crystal</strong> and she became my best friend. She loves to play with her toys and
        she loves to go out and
        rest in the grass.
        She doesnt like seafood very much so we never feed her fish. She also loves to snack on chicken flavored
        treats.
