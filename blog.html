        <h3>Early Years</h3>

            <p>Crystal was born at Doctors Hospital on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, and initially raised in
                the Bronx. As a toddler, he moved with his family to 549 East Park Avenue in Long Beach, New York,
                on Long Island. He and his older brothers Joel, who later became an art teacher, and Richard,
                nicknamed
                Rip, were the sons of Helen (née Gabler), a housewife, and Jack Crystal, who owned and operated the
                Commodore
                Music Store, founded by Crystal's grandfather, Julius Gabler. Crystal's father was also a jazz
                promoter,
                a producer, and an executive for an affiliated jazz record label, Commodore Records, founded by
                Crystal's
                uncle, musician and songwriter Milt Gabler. Crystal is Jewish (his family emigrated from Austria,
                Russia,
                and Lithuania), and he grew up attending Temple Emanu-El (Long Beach, New York) where he had his
                bar
                mitzvah. The three young brothers would entertain by reprising comedy routines from the likes of Bob
                Newhart,
                Rich Little and Sid Caesar records their father would bring home. Jazz artists such as Arvell Shaw,
                Pee Wee
                Russell, Eddie Condon, and Billie Holiday were often guests in the home. With the decline of
                Dixieland jazz
                and the rise of discount record stores, in 1963, Crystal's father lost his business and died later
                that year
                at the age of 54 after having a heart attack. His mother died in 2001.</p>
            <p>After graduating from Long Beach High School in 1965, Crystal attended Marshall University in
                Huntington,
                West Virginia, on a baseball scholarship, having learned the game from his father, who pitched for
                St. John's
                University.[citation needed] Crystal never played baseball at Marshall because the program was suspended
                during
                his first year.  He did not return to Marshall as a sophomore, instead deciding to stay in New
                York to be
                close to his future wife. He studied acting at HB Studio. He attended Nassau Community College with
                her and
                later transferred to New York University, where he was a film and television directing major. He
                graduated from NYU
                in 1970 with a BFA from its then School of Fine Arts. One of his instructors was Martin
                Scorsese, while
                Oliver Stone and Christopher Guest were among his classmates.

            <p>Crystal's first film role was in Joan Rivers' 1978 film Rabbit Test, the story of the "world's first
                pregnant man."
                 Crystal appeared briefly in the Rob Reiner "rockumentary" This Is Spinal Tap (1984) as Morty The
                Mime, a waiter
                dressed as a mime at one of Spinal Tap's parties. He shared the scene with a then-unknown, non-speaking
                Dana Carvey,
                stating famously that "Mime is money." He later starred in the action comedy Running Scared (1986)
                opposite
                Gregory Hines.</p>
            <p>He reunited with director Rob Reiner in The Princess Bride (1987), in a comedic supporting role as
                "Miracle Max".
                Reiner got Crystal to accept the part by saying, "How would you like to play Mel Brooks?" Reiner also
                allowed
                Crystal to ad-lib, and his parting shot, "Have fun storming the castle!" is a frequently quoted line.
                Critic
                Roger Ebert described Crystal as a highlight of the film writing "the funniest sequences in the film
                stars Billy
                Crystal and Carol Kane, both unrecogizable behind makeup, as an ancient wizard and crone who specialize
                in bringing
                the dead back to life".</p>
            <p>Reiner directed Crystal for a third time in the romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally... (1989). Crystal
                starred
                alongside Meg Ryan, Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher in a script written by Nora Ephron. The Hollywood
                Reporter praised
                the film and Crystal's performance writing, "Crystal’s lustrous, deeply-shaded performance is certain to
                win him
                legions of new fans; indeed, his prowess as a comic reaches its deepest human dimension here."
                Crystal was
                nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy losing to Morgan
                Freeman in
                Driving Miss Daisy (1989). The film has since become an iconic classic for the genre and is Crystal's
                most celebrated
                film. In 2019 the BBC named the film the greatest romantic comedy of all time.
